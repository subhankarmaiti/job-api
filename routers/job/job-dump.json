With over 30 years of industry experience and as a Microsoft Gold Partner with 5 Gold Competencies, we have a well-earned reputation for delivering our expert services. <br><br>Profile<br><br>Absolute Attention to detail Apply your historic hands-on technical background to effectively manage and communicate at both business and technical level with clients and team. Able to produce detailed plans, reports, budgets and other documentation but the paperwork is a reflection of, and aid to, your detailed resource and client management. It is not your primary focus - managing the tasks and team is. Identify, confront and address issues across tech, scope, time and budget. Detailed practical experience and understanding of the pros and cons of different delivery methodologies and harness them appropriately (such as Agile and Waterfall). Self-managing across projects and priorities yet constantly communicating to the internal and external team so never chased for information.<br><br><br><br>This is for individual application only - strictly no agencies, please."
